      <title>Choosing Our Own Fate</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about death in climbing and more generally why people climb and how this relates to our course in life. In the HBO series Westworld there is a quote about how death is true, and another quote about how we must all be allowed to choose our own fate. What is it that drives us to climb even though you can die while doing it? Part of the value in it for me is to know my limits and to push myself.</description>

      <description>During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 I started compiling a list of (mostly) free climbing, mountaineering, and skiing videos. I created a Google Doc that is available here. I will occasionally sync this document with the Google Doc. If you want to make suggestions, navigate to the document and add a comment. Enjoy!

      <title>Favorite Quotes From Dune</title>
      <link>https://www.johnsigmon.me/writing/favorite-dune-quotes/</link>

      <description>If you have not read Dune, drop what you are doing and go read it right now. It is a classic for a reason. Dune effortlessly blends scifi with economics, sociology, environmentalism, and religion. It is truly a masterpiece of writing.
I recently re-read it, and took down some of my favorite quotes into an iPhone note. This post is simply the transcription of those quotes. Page numbers refer to my copy which is the 50th anniversary edition.</description>

      <title>Following Inspiration</title>

      <description>For me, life has always been about doing what inspires me, in some way shape or form. I often had to compromise what inspired me in order to survive and pay my bills, and what inspired me was not even always legal. Regardless, I have always been too stubborn to not do what I wanted.
When I reflect on the influence this behavior has had in my life, I can find its influence early on.</description>

      <title>Grading On A Curve Is Bad</title>
      <link>https://www.johnsigmon.me/writing/grading-on-a-curve/</link>

      <description>It frees students from responsibility It frees professors from responsibility It is not representative of life It discourages collaboration  As a current undergraduate in electrical engineering at UT Austin, I may appear biased. I do not deny that possibility. I will say that grading on a curve never made sense to me, and my observations have allowed me to better articulate why. I hope to convince you that grading on a curve is objectively bad.</description>

      <title>Time and Money</title>

      <description>Time is the most valuable thing that anyone can ever &amp;ldquo;possess&amp;rdquo;. Moneyâ€™s primary value is to buy you more time. Money can buy you more time when you outsource household chores or labor, have the freedom to take a part time job, have the freedom to start a company or non-profit, or even when you retire.
Due to my belief, I sometimes cause myself trouble by passing judgement on those that waste their time.</description>
