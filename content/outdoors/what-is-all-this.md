title: "What is all this?"
toc: false

The more I venture outdoors, the more I find myself wishing I had taken better notes. As I plan, I know I have been on similar terrain in similar temps. How long did it take me? What did I do wrong? What clothes should I wear or how much food should I bring?

These trip reports are an attempt for me to catalog these aspects and more.

I know that if I set out to write full trip reports I just won't do it... There is a pile of unorganized trip report notes going back several years to prove it. Therefore, if anyone reading this wants more information on a particular objective, feel free to reach out via email (johnsigmon@gmail.com) and I'll do my best to answer your questions.

Hopefully all of these reports are recorded on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/47263412).
