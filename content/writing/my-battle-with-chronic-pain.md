## Intro

This writing is about the details of my sufferings with a repetitive strain injury (RSI)[^1] that was debilitating for over a year and has affected me daily since early 2018. The emotional stress of having a chronic injury cannot be overstated. It dampens everything like a heavy blanket. I wrote this to help other computer workers who may be enduring similar problems. My hope is that I help others cope with the emotional stress while their body recovers and they relearn how to interact with the world around them. You are not alone, and it can get better.

## Onset

In the spring of 2018 I was in school full time. As usual, I was taking too many courses. I spent 8 to 10 hours a day at the computer, 7 days a week. Having never learned proper seated desk ergonomics [^1](/writing/my-battle-with-chronic-pain/#fn:1). I was doing it all wrong.[^2] The other contributing factor was that I was in classes, not work. At a job you may spend a lot of time reviewing, maintaining, and planning code. With classes I had assignment after assignment, which meant hours and hours of _typing_.

As a result, my hands and wrist started hurting on a daily basis. Normally I took spring break off so my body at least had a week off, but  that year I stayed home to work. Without a single day off for months I was in constant pain that extended from my hands into my shoulders by the end of May 2018. I took two weeks off to go hiking and hoped the time off would let my body heal. There was no change. The situation started to look bleak.

## Worsening

Over summer my condition worsened. The first doctor I saw told me that I had carpal tunnel, which in retrospect was obviously wrong. I had compression of my ulnar nerve causing numbness in my pinky, while carpal tunnel causes numbness in the other fingers via compression of the median nerve. I saw another doctor a few weeks later who told me that behavior modifications and rest were the only cures. My summer internship along with weekend side projects kept me at the computer constantly. 

By the end of the summer everyday tasks caused pain. Using my phone, writing, holding a book, vacuuming, and petting my cat were all sources of pain. My whole upper body fell out of whack as my shoulders started to tense up and ache as much as my hands. In August of 2018 with my internship money I was able to purchase health insurance through the school and start physical therapy.[^3]

My first physical therapist (PT) had no idea how to treat my ongoing hand issues but she went to work fixing my shoulder issues.[^4]  By October of 2018, about 7 months after I first noticed pain, I was not able to use a computer for more than a few minutes and relied heavily on voice recognition (which leaves a lot to be desired.) Luckily any software I had to write for school in those last two semesters I was able to do via pair programming.[^5] I then started a new part-time job which required software development and this was the only computer use I could manage without extreme pain.

In the fall of 2018 I also started with a massage therapist[^6] and acupuncturist footnote(go see nap). The acupuncture helped quite a bit at first, if for no other reason than to force me to rest and relax for a few minutes. The massage therapist found muscles in my upper body that I didn’t know existed, and the first few sessions were so painful that I struggled to breath. My body soon adjusted and loosened up, and continuing that work became a critical part of my learning more body awareness.

Working with the PT improved my shoulders but did nothing for my hands. I saw doctors three and four that fall. Doctor three recommended PT (which I was already doing.) Doctor four did a nerve study on the left side that was inconclusive because the numbness wasn’t active at the time of the study. 

Several times with the PT I was told I was doing an exercise wrong after I had been doing it that way for weeks (the PT would write notes on her computer most of the time instead of working with me.) I finally decided I should do the exercises on my own in front of a mirror and that it wasn't worth the time and money to keep going. My insurance ran out and money was tight so by the beginning of 2019 I was focused on maintaining my shoulder exercises at home and experimenting with ways to relieve my hand pain. I stopped the acupuncture in early 2019 as the benefits started to seem marginal and time and money were tight. I kept seeing the massage therapist regularly and had zero regrets about that.

By the beginning of 2019, morale was low and the future looked as barren as ever. I had some moderate progress with my shoulders but the reality that my life was permanently altered had settled in.

## Recovery
I finally began to realize that I was going to have to take control of my own recovery. I learned everything I could, starting with a basic anatomy textbook footnote(grays) to figure out how my dysfunctional body parts worked and what the bones and muscles were called. From there I picked up the basic terminology needed to understand and review research papers and more intermediate texts (footnote kinesiology). I dug into alternative treatments as well, learning about the Alexander technique (link) and its variations (footnote).

By mid-spring 2019 I felt strong enough to start yoga (footnote 30 days of yoga with adriene was  a turning point for me) I did beginner’s yoga videos everyday for 30 days and it helped me  build strength, showed me where I was too flexible, and showed me where I needed to be more flexible. Yoga helped me gain awareness of my body and learn more about when I was being tense and using my body incorrectly. I started to realize that modifications in awareness were going to be my long-term solution, and that these modifications would be a life-long journey.

As an uninsured student, I sought a referral for another PT who diagnosed me with weakness in the intrinsic muscles of my hands. footnote(As an aside most of your flexion and extension of your fingers occurs in the muscles of the forearm. The muscles that occur inside the hand do abduction and adduction of the fingers as well as the interesting case of your main knuckle being flexed but the middle knuckle being extended.) I didn’t care for him personally but I thought he was onto something. That visit was a turning point for my hands, and I started to take responsibility for my hand therapy. I started developing and playing with my own regimen of exercises for my hands, and I kept a detailed logbook of the outcomes, turning myself into an ongoing experiment.

The summer of 2019 was two steps forward and one step backward. I would notice improvements, and then regress, cueing an emotional rollercoaster each time. I was finally able to type again for longer periods of time, and started rock climbing again by the end of the summer. I maintained the exercises that worked and would constantly surprise myself by doing an activity without pain that was previously difficult. Continued self massage, yoga, and work on my posture and body awareness was crucial in the small improvements I gained.

## Looking Forward
By the end of 2019 I could occasionally use a computer for several hours without pain. As  usual, I pushed the boundaries by starting on side projects on the weekends, which led to regression. But even the ability to *begin* to think about using a computer for pleasure made me optimistic for the future again. I do my exercises almost everyday, and pay for it when I don’t. I still sometimes slump in my chair and catch myself tensed up into weird positions. But I have learned to be aware of these things and to value progress over perfection. 

I would encourage anyone struggling with RSI to seek treatment and stop the overuse as soon as possible. Many RSI’s can cause permanent damage to the tendons and there is a lot that is not known about these conditions so it can be very difficult to find effective treatment. I cope mostly on my own faculty and I have seen almost a dozen medical professionals. Find someone to talk to about it (footnote you can email me if you’d like) as well-  the emotional effects of a chronic disability can be quite harrowing.

I purposefully left out specific treatment details, as everyone’s body is different and can react differently to different treatments. I would be happy to discuss the specifics in private, but must disclose that I am not a doctor and I am not legally qualified to give out medical advice. Common themes in stories of those recovered (including mine) tend to be increased body awareness and motor control (via yoga, massage, PT) and ongoing maintenance to ward off regression of symptoms (self-massage, exercises, etc.) Many that catch it early have found relief from changing their environment footnote(devices). My hope is that this post helps someone feel seen or heard in their battle to diagnose and treat chronic pain.
