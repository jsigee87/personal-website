Time is the most valuable thing that anyone can ever "possess". Money’s primary value is to buy you more time. Money can buy you more time when you outsource household chores or labor, have the freedom to take a part time job, have the freedom to start a company or non-profit, or even when you retire.

Due to my belief, I sometimes cause myself trouble by passing judgement on those that waste their time. The biggest offenders are television and social media. Of course, my judgement is not fair. I spent a large portion of my life doing nothing but wasting time. I had hobbies, learned every once in a while, and made some money. But all I did with that money was squander it and indulge myself. My only aim was immediate gratification, when it should have been freedom.

Maybe gratification is what it is all about though? At this moment, I have in my mind a sharp contrast between two different ideals. One is a spiritual life of mindfulness, along the lines of a Buddhist monk. The other is a life of education and creation. Maybe these views don’t seem opposing. One can learn more to better educate others. But what if this motivation to learn serves only to stroke the ego?

Supposing these ideals are contrasting, then how does an individual balance them? Surely an ideal society (whatever that means) is not all monks, and surely it is not all Henry Fords. I suspect the answer lies in the middle and that society benefits from the existence of both types.

So then how should I spend my time? Pursuing money to buy more time? As a monk in poverty, with a life of service? I am certain that the way that I spent much of my life is not the right answer. However, it has served to bring me exactly to this point and to this question.

For now, I pursue education with my time. I am sure to break up my time with solitude in nature, where I can reflect the best. I am looking for a turning point, as I am unsure I should carry on forever solely in the pursuit of more knowledge.
