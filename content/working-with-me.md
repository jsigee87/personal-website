title: "Working With Me"
---

I consult with companies of all shapes and sizes that are interested in using the cloud or data, selling their product, or developing internal processes.

Professionally, I love finding bottlenecks and removing them. Creating efficiency brings me joy. I have worked in many industries and previously owned a successful small business. I returned to school later in life, earning a degree in electrical engineering from UT Austin.

I have worked with early stage startups, state agencies, and enterprise organizations, both as an employee, and as a consultant. Some ways I may be able to help your company or team are:

1. Early stage startups
  *  Navigate the enterprise or public sector sales process
  *  Create plans for engineering recruitment, selection, and training
  *  Prototype proof of concepts
  *  Architect and/or develop software automation and CI/CD
  *  Plan or review cloud architecture and infrastructure
  *  Creating engineering process to allows for rapid company growth

2. Organizations of any size that want to
  * Add devops, automated deployment and/or testing, CI/CD
  * Add machine learning to your product or product line
  * Migrate your on-premise or other non-cloud databases to the cloud
  * Deploy a cloud provider across your entire organization
