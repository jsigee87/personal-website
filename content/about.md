My name is John Sigmon and I am passionate about:

- Creating useful things
- Sharing what I know
- Learning more about myself and the world
- Finding my limits in athletic activities

I like thinking about what drives me and the people around me. I love learning new things and mastering them as well as being challenged mentally and physically. I have previously worked as an auto repair technician (where I started and owned a shop), a bartender, and in many other jobs and industries. I am also a rock climber, mountaineer, skier, and runner.

Iâ€™d love to chat with anyone on any of the following topics, among other things:
- Quitting drinking or smoking
- Becoming vegan, or eating less meat
- Anything related to addiction or 12 step programs
- Decision making and risk tolerances
- The role of our ego in our choice of career or our everyday lives
- Learning how to learn new things
- Overcoming injury and physical adversities
- Hiking, backpacking, climbing, skiing, mountaineering
- Planning any such outdoor trips
- Choosing gear related to any of the above outdoor activities
- Mountain lions

If you want to talk, feel free to create a time via this [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/johnsigmon1/chat).

You can find out more about me via my writing on this site or my social media accounts linked on the home page.
