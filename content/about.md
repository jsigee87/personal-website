My name is John Sigmon and I am currently a data engineer. I am passionate about:

1. Creating useful things
2. Sharing what I know
3. Learning more about myself and the world
4. Finding my limits in athletic activities

I like thinking about what drives me and the people around me. I love learning new things and mastering them as well as being challenged mentally and physically. I have previously worked as an auto repair technician (where I started and owned a shop), a bartender, and in many other jobs and industries. I am an avid runner and rock climber (when my body cooperates.)

You can find out more about me in my writing on this site, via my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_fsqtKILiTvK6PihnKdySmwBEJ3eiNjRKEItrcaz_Q/edit?usp=sharing), or via my social media accounts linked on my home page.
